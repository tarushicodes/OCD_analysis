# OCD_analysis
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by recurring 
obsessions and compulsions. The dataset contains demographic, diagnostic, and treatment-related 
information about OCD patients. The goal is to analyze this dataset to understand the factors affecting 
OCD severity, identify patterns in medication usage, and address missing information to improve data 
completeness for better decision-making. 
Objective: 
To identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of OCD severity using patient demographics, 
symptoms, and treatment data. Additionally, explore how medication use varies across different 
patient groups.
